# AI Answer Engine

An AI Answer Engine built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** that can scrape content from websites and mitigate hallucinations by citing its sources when providing answers. Users can input any website, and the AI Engine will provide a detailed summary of the web content or indicate if it is not scrapeable.
